# subprocess module enables you to start new applications from your Python program

import X
Imports the module X, and creates a reference to that module in the current namespace. 
Then you need to define completed module path to access a particular attribute or method from inside the module (e.g.: X.name or X.attribute)

from X import *
Imports the module X, and creates references to all public objects defined by that module in the current namespace 
(that is, everything that doesnâ€™t have a name starting with _) or whatever name you mentioned. 
Or, in other words, after you've run this statement, you can simply use a plain (unqualified) name to refer to things defined in module X. 
But X itself is not defined, so X.name doesn't work. And if name was already defined, it is replaced by the new version. 
And if name in X is changed to point to some other object, your module won't notice.
This makes all names from the module available in the local namespace.
