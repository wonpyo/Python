# A function is reusable code that can be called anywhere in your program. Functions improve readability of your code: 
# itâ€™s easier for someone to understand code using functions instead of long lists of instructions.
# On top of that, functions can be reused or modified which also improve testability and extensibility.
# The def keyword tells Python we have a piece of reusable code (A function). A program can have many functions.
