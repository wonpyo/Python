# Create and read a csv file: i.e. database files such as spreadsheet or csv by exporting and importing the data in database
# Note that the csv reader is only allowed to iterate only once. 
# => Reset the file iterator to beginning of the input file to avoid the issue.

'''
Spreadsheets often export CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, because they are easy to read and write.
A csv file simply consists of values, commas, and newlines.
While the file is called CSV file, you can use another separator such as the pipe character.
