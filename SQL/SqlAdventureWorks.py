With Microsoft's ODBC drivers for SQL Server, Trusted_connection=Yes tells the driver to use "Windows Authentication" 
and your script will attempt to log in to the SQL Server using the Windows credentials of the user running the script. 
UID and PWD cannot be used to supply alternative Windows credentials in the connection string, 
so if you need to connect as some other Windows user you will need to use RUNAS to run the Python script as that other user.
If you want to use "SQL Server Authentication" with a specific SQL Server login specified by UID and PWD then use Trusted_connection=No.

We can't use sqlite3 to connect to SQL server, only to Sqlite databases. You need to use a driver that can talk to MS SQL, like pyodbc.
